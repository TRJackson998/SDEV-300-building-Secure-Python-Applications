# SDEV-300-building-Secure-Python-Applications
A class taken in 2024 at UMGC.

A study of object-oriented and concurrent programming using features of Java. The goal is to design, implement, test, debug, and document complex robust programs in an object-oriented language. Concepts of object-oriented programming (such as composition, classification, and polymorphism) are explored. Topics include the principles of concurrent programming (such as task synchronization, race conditions, deadlock, threads, and event-driven graphic user interface programs). Programming projects are implemented in Java. Students may receive credit for only one of the following courses: CMSC 300 or CMSC 335.
